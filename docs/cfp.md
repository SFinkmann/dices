---

We are pleased to invite colleagues working on ancient and late antique epic, discourse analysis, narratology, linguistics and digital humanities to join our new network on Direct Speech in Ancient and Late Antique Epic. Located at the intersection of these disciplines, the <a href="/">Epic Speeches Network</a> aims to generate innovative new research by bringing together scholars with complementary expertise in a collaborative environment. 

As the first product of the Epic Speeches Networkâ€™s research, we envision a peer reviewed edited volume showcasing experimental digital methods and new possibilities for diachronic analysis of speech in the Graeco-Roman epic tradition.  All members will be invited to work with a prototype version of the <a href="/dices/#database">DICES database</a>, comprising metadata on all instances of direct speech in Greek and Latin epic from Homer to Late Antiquity, linked to digital libraries and repositories of open data on ancient people and places. 

To facilitate cooperation and provide participants with training and support for the use of DICES tools and data, we will be organising two successive workshops: the first at the University of Rostock (Germany)  7-9 June 2022 for presentation of early ideas, forging collaboration and demonstrations of digital tools and methods; the second at Mount Allison University (Canada) in the summer of 2023 for presentations of final drafts, troubleshooting and brainstorming for future projects. The proposed deadline for submission of manuscripts for the volume will likely be in the autumn of 2023, with the aim of publishing in 2024.

All colleagues interested in joining this network are invited to submit a short CV (or link to a personal research profile) and a 300-500 word proposal by 1 October 2021, specifying one or more topics or research questions they would be interested in tackling with the help of our data. If applicable, please also mention your previous experience with programming and digital tools and methods. Joint proposals, especially from teams combining a digital and linguistic/literary research focus, are most welcome. We will also be actively stimulating new such collaborations among our network members.
