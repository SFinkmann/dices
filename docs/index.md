<h3>Direct speech in Greek and Latin Epic, from Homer to Nonnus</h3>

DICES is an international research collaboration for the study of direct speech in Greek and Latin epic poetry. Through the use of digital methods, we are able to approach the poetry of late antiquity from a diachronic perspective based on distant reading of the larger epic corpus.

<h4>Linked open data for speeches</h4>

The heart of the project is an effort to construct a **comprehensive, authoritative database of direct speech in Greek and Latin epic**. Standard identifiers for characters and textual loci permit us to draw on (and contribute to) an extensive ecosystem of linked open data for Classics, further broadening the potential reach of our analysis.
