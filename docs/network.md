The <strong>Epic Speeches Network</strong> aims to generate innovative new research on Graeco-Roman epic poetry, particularly its use of direct speech, by combining methods and theoretical models from narratology, discourse analysis, linguistics and digital humanities, bringing together scholars with complementary expertise in a collaborative environment. 

The initiative for this new network was taken by the <a href="/dices">DICES project</a>, but the founders warmly invite new members to take part in the network’s joint research agenda. As a first research project, we are working towards a peer-reviewed edited volume showcasing the potential of experimental digital methods (such as the DICES database) for diachronic analysis of speech in the Graeco-Roman epic tradition. To this end, the network is organising a <a href="/cfp">series of workshops</a> at the University of Rostock (Germany) 2022 and Mount Allison University (Canada) 2023.
