Caution! The project is still very much in development and the features described here are far from stable, and indeed frequently broken.

### Web-based search

The database does not yet have a human-oriented web interface, but one day it will.

### Python client

A python-based client for interacting programmatically with the API is under development. The code is available at [dices-client](https://github.com/cwf2/dices-client). There are a couple of Jupyter Notebooks giving examples of its use at [dices-examples](https://github.com/cwf2/dices-examples); the latter can be tested online via [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/cwf2/dices-examples/main).

### API

The database has a machine-oriented API. This is under development and will be volatile for a while... at least through 2021. If you're not easily frustrated, you can poke at our development prototype on Heroku: `https://fierce-ravine-99183.herokuapp.com/api`
